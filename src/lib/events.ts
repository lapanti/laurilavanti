 * Visibility rules for the campaign event calendar.

 * The build decides what is visible and the nightly scheduled-publish workflow

 * inverted: posts appear when their date arrives, events disappear once theirs
 * has passed.
 *
 * Kept free of astro:content and import.meta.env so both Vite-processed code and
 * plain-Node check scripts can import it; the dev-mode exception lives at the
 * Astro call site, like loadAllPosts in posts.ts.
